It is agile, extensible, and based on years of system administration best practices and experience. It enables you to:\r\n\r\n* Provision Operating Systems on physical or virtual machines: RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, SLES, AIX, Windows, VMWare, KVM, PowerVM, zVM.\r\n* Provision using scripted install, stateless, statelite, iSCSI, or cloning\r\n* Remotely manage systems: lights-out management, remote console, and distributed shell support\r\n* Quickly configure and control management node services: DNS, HTTP, DHCP, TFTP, NFS\r\n\r\n### xCAT Differentiators\r\n\r\n* xCAT Scales - Beyond all IT budgets. 1,000s of nodes with distributed architecture\r\n* Open Source - Eclipse Public License. You can also buy support contracts.\r\n* More Installation Options - Install to Hard Disk, run stateless (Diskless), run diskless with a little bit of state (Statelite), install to iSCSI (no special hardware required), virtual machines (VMWare, KVM, Xen, PowerVM, zVM)\r\n* Built in Automagic discovery - no need to power on one machine at a time to discover. Also, nodes that fail can be replaced and back in action by just powering them on \r\n\r\n## Get Started with xCAT\r\n\r\n* Download xCAT\r\n* Try xCAT iDataPlex Cluster Quick Start\r\n* Or go to [xCAT Documentation](http://github.com/bmpotter/xCAT/wiki) and pick your environment\r\n* Need help? xCAT Mailing List \r\n\r\n## Go Further with xCAT\r\n\r\n* xCAT Features and Supported HW/OS\r\n* Tips and Tricks\r\n* HowTos\r\n* Debugging xCAT Problems \r\n* Wish List for xCAT\r\n* Bug List for xCAT\r\n* xCAT Users "}
